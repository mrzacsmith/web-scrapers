Create a database that allows me to track competitions, where users are able to
enter goals, and daily entries. Users score points for meeting their goals in
each daily entry.
The contests encourage healthy behaviors. Users have to set goals and record
daily entries for the following:
* hours of sleep
* oz of water drunk
* calories eaten
* grams of protein
* grams of carbs
* grams of fat
Points are scored for an entry based on the goal the entry relates to (the most
recent goal set when the entry is made.)
Users can create competitions, be designated as administrators of a competition,
and be participants in a competition.
Each competition must have one creator, and one administrator. The creator is
the default administrator.
